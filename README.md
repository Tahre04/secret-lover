This project is a React application bootstrapped with Create React App. It serves as a starting point for building modern web applications with React.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Create React App structure:

- `public/`: Contains the public assets like `index.html`, `favicon.ico`, etc.
- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the React application, including components, styles, and application logic.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
